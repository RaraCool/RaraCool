Hello. I am Rara, and I am quite new to coding in any capacity beyond Scratch. I want to make several Game Bar widgets, as well as get to a point where I can help the development of the OBS Project in any way.

This will mean I am currently interested in learning C# and C++, however I understand that I have pretty far to go before I can do anything meaningful, but I'm looking to give it a shot!

This is just for fun, so there's no need for any professional ways of contacting me, but if you're really looking to, my Discord is Rara Cool#2513

By the way, I'm self taught, so if I'm talking through my ass, please tell me!
